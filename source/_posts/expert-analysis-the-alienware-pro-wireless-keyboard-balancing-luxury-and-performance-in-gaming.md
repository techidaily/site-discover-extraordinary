Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 In recent years, mechanical keyboards for gaming have largely settled on a 75% size form factor. The Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Keyboard continues with this trend. At this size, the keyboard is compact but still big enough that nothing significant is removed—except for a numbers pad, which isn’t typically necessary for gaming purposes. It still contains function row keys and arrow keys like full-size keyboards.

 The six-rowed keyboard is gorgeous, has terrific build quality, and is available in black or white. Not surprisingly, the first thing you’ll probably notice about this keyboard when you give it power is its 16.8 million color RGB lighting, which extends magically across all 83 keys, adding a stunning visual element to your gaming setup.

 The bottom of the keyboard includes a long silicone strip that covers the front edge. This stabilizes the keyboard and improves its grip on the table. The stands on the bottom of the keyboard can be adjusted to two steps.

 As the name suggests, this keyboard can be used wirelessly. However, it also works well wired, allowing you to adapt to your gaming setup. It supports Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections and ships with a 2-meter USB-A to USB-C paracord cable for wired use.

 At 1.81 pounds, the keyboard is light enough to freely move it around the house. Its 75% size measures 12.3 in x 5.0 x 1.6 inches. It allows up to five on-board memory profiles for others in your family to use or connect to extra devices. My Alienware Pro Wireless Keyboard was in black, “Dark Side of the Moon.” There’s also a white version, “Lunar Light.”

###  Battery Life Inconsistency

 It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that using a 2.4GHz connection and RGB lights really affects a keyboard’s battery life. With the Alienware Pro keyboard, there’s a difference between 72 hours between charges with RGB activated and up to 1,800 hours with Bluetooth on and RGB disabled.

 This is a considerable range. However, I’d suggest it means very little when you consider you can charge the keyboard overnight if you are committed to using RGB.

##  Smooth, Adjustable Key Switches and Necessary Accessories

 The Alienware Pro keyboard has linear mechanical switches that provide 40 grams of actuation force, or the pressure required to register a keystroke.

 The keyboard feels solid when typing, and every key even pushed lightly, gets it right the first time. Meanwhile, the internal polyoxymethylene thermoplastic (POM) on the stem of each key guarantees the clicking sound you want from mechanical keyboards.

 During my tests, I didn’t experience any accidental key presses or lag time. Tactile feedback was also terrific, as it should be for mechanical keyboards. I used the Alienware Pro while briefly playing games like "Last Epoch_," "_Fallout 4," and "Manor Lords."

 The keyboard doesn’t come with extra keys. However, it’s hot-swappable, so you can swap individual switches easily using an included tool. You can replace switches in either 3-pin or 5-pin configurations.

 In addition to the keycap and switch puller, the Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Keyboard comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, USB-A to USB-C adapter, Type-C dongle, dongle extender, an Alienware sticker, quick start guide, and regulatory document. The keyboard’s backside includes three inputs: a power slider, a Type-C dongle storage dongle, and a mode switch button.

###  Software for Customization

 Download [Alienware Command Center](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2002904%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fen-us%2Fdrivers%2Fdriversdetails%3Fdriverid%3Dnnr5t) version 6.1 or later on your Windows 10 or later PC to customize the lighting on the Alienware keyboard. Assuming you’re using the keyboard with an Alienware computer, you probably already have this software installed on your machine. Otherwise, get it and make the keyboard your own. The process was smooth and added to the keyboard's value.

##  Should You Buy the Alienware Pro Wireless Keyboard?

 The [Alienware Pro Wireless Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-Pro-Wireless-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B09JY1DY5L/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002904&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Falienware-pro-wireless-keyboard-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is expensive—until you see what [other mechanical keyboards cost](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ross-platform-strategies-to-boost-youtube-presence/). Although I believe part of the $200 cost is simply based on the Alienware name. Assuming you are a heavy gamer, I still think it’s worth it. For good measure, it’s also important to note Team Liquid was included in developing the keyboard. The company is a major Dutch-based esports organization with over 150 players on its team.

 Beyond the keyboard’s price, I can’t see another reason not to purchase this product, assuming you are, at minimum, a casual gamer. Sure, the battery life shrinks to 72 hours with RGB activated, but that’s probably not important to most folks.
