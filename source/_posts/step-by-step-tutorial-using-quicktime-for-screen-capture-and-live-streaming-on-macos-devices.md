##  Part 2\. QuickTime Screen Recording No Sound? Why and How to Fix?

QuickTime is far from perfect when you adopt it to [record Mac screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) with computer audio, even when you raise the volume on your speakers. Why is there no sound on QuickTime screen recording Mac? Generally, the wrong microphone settings or sound input settings are the major culprit.

How to recover sound from screen recording on Mac? Follow the instructions below:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

###  Solution 1\. Check and Change Microphone Settings

 Head to System Preferences on your macOS computer by clicking Apple logo at the upper left corner of the UI. Then tap Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone > Check if QuickTime player is allowed to use microphone. If not, enable it.

###  Solution 2\. Check the Sound Input Settings

 Microphone settings have no problem but still no sound in your Mac screen recording? Go and check sound input settings. Still under System Preferences, hit Sound from the latter window > Input > opt for a microphone from the menu list and 2 key factors show up, too: Input volume and input level.

Input volume is easy to understand, and you'd better move the slide bar to crank up the volume so that your MacBook Pro or iMac can record screen with sound at comparatively louder volume (or hearable level). As for input level, it reflects the real-time sound volume, higher or lower. If there is no response on input level (when input volume is okay), probably your Microphone gets broken and needs to be repaired or changed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

###  Solution 3\. Screen Capture Content is Copyright Protected

 Sometimes, all the settings related to sound are correct but your QuickTime screen recording still lacks audio. That might be the capture content to blame. Some DRM-protected contents like YouTube movie, music video, iTunes movies, TV shows are encrypted so that your QuickTime player might only capture video image, no audio. 

###  Solution 4\. Deactivate "Use Ambient Noise Reduction" Setting

 There is an extra option for macOS Mojave users - "Use Ambient Noise Reduction". It's designed to reduce the external noise interference. Yet, you're advised to disable this setting, for sometimes it would confuse voice and noise so as to mute your voice, as well. Record your Mac screen using QuickTime player to try again after turning off this setting.

###  Solution 5\. QT Screen Record with Audio Soundflower

Utilize your QuickTime player under the assistance of Soundflower, which helps you record screen on Mac with audio you need. Check the below detailed steps if Soundflower is strange to you.

**Step 1:** Go to [Github](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/tag/2.0b2) to finding Soundflower-2.0b2.dmg to download and install Soundflower.

**Step 2:** Restart your MacBook, iMac or Mac Mini.

**Step 3:** Navigate to Sound system preference > choose Output tab > select SoundFlower (2ch) for current audio recording.
