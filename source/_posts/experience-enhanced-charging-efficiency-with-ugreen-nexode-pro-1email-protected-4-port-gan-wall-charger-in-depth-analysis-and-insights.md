##  Out of the Box: I Wish the Plug Was in a Different Spot

 The Nexode Pro 160W isn’t much bigger than the traditional power supply that comes with a MacBook or similar laptop. At 2.5 inches tall, 1.30 inches wide, and 2.75 inches from front to back, it’s a relatively easy [charger](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) to travel with, but it’s also going to integrate well into most desk workstation setups.

 The only thing I can see being a problem is the charger depth, which is something I’m betting most folks will also run into with a traditional laptop charger. At close to three inches, it’s going to be hard to get a desk or table flush against whatever wall the Nexode Pro is hanging out on. While it would have only saved a half-inch or two, it would have been awesome if Ugreen was able to place the plug on the wider side of the charger.

 A plug relocation would also help to prevent USB cables from being shoved against the back of a desk or table. In its current configuration, the USB ports face out toward the room, but if the plug were re-positioned, the USB ports could face toward the floor or ceiling. It’s a small gripe, but one I felt was worth mentioning.

 In terms of cosmetics, we’re dealing with the typical Ugreen shell colors. A matte gray casing covers most of the charger, which is joined by a small area of black trimming where all the USB ports are located. From top to bottom, there are three [USB-C connections](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/) and one USB-A. The charger’s foldable prongs are located on the opposite side of the USB port section.

##  Features: The Usual Suspects

 Like many other Ugreen products, the Nexode Pro 160W is equipped with the company’s GaNInfinity tech. Many other charging devices are engineered using silicone, which is less efficient at dissipating heat and often requires a larger chassis. One of Ugreen’s big claims with the Nexode Pro 160W is that it’s 21% smaller than a MacBook charger, and the GaN engineering is a major reason why.

 But that’s not all! The Nexode Pro 160W also features Thermal Guard protection, which is basically an internal temperature monitor for the charger. I noticed the Nexode Pro got pretty toasty when using the 140W USB-C connection, or when charging multiple devices at once, but I felt assured that Thermal Guard would keep things safe. This is also a feature I’ve been able to test on several other Ugreen products.

 When it comes to charging multiple components, the Nexode Pro is also equipped with Ugreen’s SmartCharge feature. This allows the charger to distribute power to the devices that need it most, which makes for safer and more energy-efficient charging in the long run.

##  Charging: Performs As Expected

 During my testing of the Nexode Pro 160W, I used the charger to top off a few of my everyday workplace devices. This included a late 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, an iPhone 12, AirPods Pro 2, and a pair of Sony Bluetooth headphones with ANC.

 I was able to get the best results when charging my MacBook Pro by itself, and I’ll happily go on record to say I’d buy the Nexode Pro as a total replacement for the charger the MacBook comes with. Using the Thunderbolt 4 cable that came with the computer, I connected the laptop to the 140W USB-C port on the Nexode Pro.

 During one test, I plugged the computer in at 6:36 PM with the battery level at 56%. By 7:18 PM the battery had gone up to 85%, and by 8:00 PM the MacBook was fully charged.

 Ugreen claims the Nexode Pro can charge a MacBook Pro from zero to 50% in as little as 27 minutes, but that’s with a [140W MagSafe charging cable](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/soundtracking-dreams-an-overview-of-magix-fx/). Considering my MacBook Pro charger is only rated for up to 61W, and that I wasn’t using a 140W MagSafe cable, I would say the Nexode Pro did a fantastic job at charging up my laptop.

 The second USB-C port from the top dishes out a total of 100W with no other devices connected, which was great for [charging up my iPhone](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/). I have a bad habit of depleting my phone battery, but in most cases, all it took was around 20 minutes for the Nexode Pro to add 35 percent (or more) battery life back to the phone.

 When using all four ports at once, the two top USB-C ports are reduced to 65W, while the bottom USB-C and USB-A put out a total of 15W. If all of my device batteries were running low, I would connect my MacBook and iPhone to the two top ports, and my AirPods and Sony headphones to the bottom two.

 Loading up a charger always makes me worried about overheating. Even though the Nexode Pro ran warm when being used, this didn’t seem to impact its overall charging capabilities. Plus, I felt at ease because of the Thermal Guard feature.

##  Should You Buy the Ugreen Nexode Pro 160W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger?

 For $120, I think the [Ugreen Nexode Pro 160W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001462&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-pro-160w-4-port-gan-wall-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is worth the investment for those of us with cash to spare.

 Sure, a replacement charger for your MacBook or Windows laptop may only cost around $50, but I don't think most of those power bricks are going to give you the wattage output and smart charging features of the Nexode Pro.
